# Union Tech 2026

**Union Data and Technology Conference**
Wayne State University, Detroit

**April 17-18, 2026**

Union Tech 2026 is a focused, practitioner-centered conference for organizers, data managers, analysts, developers, and researchers to collaboratively examine how union data systems (CRMs, spreadsheets, databases, texting platforms, member portals, and custom-built systems) are built, maintained, and used in practice.

Participants will explore how data systems reshape organizing work and coordination across locals and regions. The conference will combine practical discussion of tools and infrastructure with reflection on the evolving purpose of data in organizing and the career paths that data work creates inside unions.

Sessions will focus on concrete dilemmas of data collection, use, training, and coordination, offering space to learn from peers, share experience from the field, and think together about how future union data systems can support both worker initiative and collective capacity under changing technical and organizational conditions.
